Project Summary: A straightforward approach to initiating learning about Node.js and utilizing npm packages (Express.js, Axios, and body-parser) for integrating with a public API.

Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer
1.1 If you don't have node.js installed you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
Download the GIT files for this project locally.
Open the files in your code editor (I prefer to use VS Code) and access the terminal from within your code editor.
Run npm init on your terminal - this will create a new file called packaged.json
Open packaged.json and underneath ' "main": "index.js" ', type ' "type": "module" '(to use ECMAScript Modules instead of CJS).
Run $npm i express (for PC) or %npm i express (for Mac) on your terminal
Run $npm i axios (for PC) or %npm i axios (for Mac) on your terminal
Run $npm i ejs (for PC) or %npm i ejs (for Mac) on your terminal
Run node index.js
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/ to view the API working!
